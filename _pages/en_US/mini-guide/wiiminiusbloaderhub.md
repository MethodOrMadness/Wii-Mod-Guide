title: Using a USB Hub
---

When USB loading games on the Wii Mini, we strongly recommend using a USB hub, as the Wii Mini only has one USB port, and there is no other way to load homebrew on it, meaning that if you don't use a USB hub, you will have to store everything on one USB drive or constantly be switching out USB drives.

We recommend purchasing a powered USB hub with a built in ethernet port, such as [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Unitek-Ethernet-Converter-Charging-Compatible/dp/B06XKZLZXL). If you do not get a powered USB hub, the console may not be able to provide enough power for all your USB devices.

Once you have decided if you are going to use a USB hub or not, you may proceed to [choosing a suitable USB drive for games](/wiiminiusbselectionguide)
