## Things you need

Before you can begin, you'll need the following things:

- A computer (with Bluetooth support, either built in or using a USB adapter) **running Linux**
  - There are many ways to do this, but we recommend creating a Live USB. You can find many tutorials on how to do this online. We recommend using the latest version of Ubuntu.
  - If you are using a Live USB, you will need a USB drive that is at least 4GB.
  - You will need to be connected to the internet while you are on Linux.
  - Make sure it is near your Wii Mini. We recommend keeping it within 10 feet.
- A Wii Mini (obviously)
  - Make sure you have a Wiimote that is synced to the console, so that you can connect it in the HackMii Installer later on.
  - While not necessary, it's helpful to have your console connected to a display while performing the hack.
- A USB drive with at least 2GB of storage formatted as FAT32
  - It cannot be the same one as your Live USB.
  - You need a way to transfer files to it.
- The latest version of the [Hackmii Installer](https://bootmii.org/download/)

## Preparing the exploit USB

In order to use Bluebomb, you will have to have a program for the Wii to execute. This is where the USB Drive comes in.

1. Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32.

2. Extract the HackMii Installer .zip that you downloaded previously.

3. Inside the extracted contents, find ``boot.elf`` (not ``boot.elf``!) and move it to the root of your USB drive.

4. Eject the USB drive from your computer.
