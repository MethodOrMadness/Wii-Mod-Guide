title: Wii Mini Homebrew Tips
---

Great job! You've now fully softmodded your Wii Mini and, if you chose to do so, connected it to the internet and/or set up a USB Loader.

Before we let you go, we'd like to give you a few tips/warnings to keep in mind as you run homebrew on your Wii Mini to avoid bricks and overall improve your experience.

- Do not attempt to install a System Menu or IOS designed for the original Wii. It will result in a brick.
- There is currently no known way to get Riivolution working on the Wii Mini.
- Anything that requires an SD Card (BootMii, CTGP-R, etc.) will not work unless you solder an SD card slot on.
- We do not recommend running homebrew that has not been tested on the Wii Mini. The [Wii Mini Hacking Discord](https://discord.gg/zyPKqt4) is a great place to find out more about a specific homebrew app, especially an obscure one.

Enjoy your homebrewed Wii Mini!

At the moment, we have no other tutorials to offer, but stay tuned! More will be added in the future.
