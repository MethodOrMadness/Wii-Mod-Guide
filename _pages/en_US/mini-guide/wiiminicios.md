cIOS is a very important part of Wii softmodding. Its primary function is to allow the playing of backup games, but it does other things as well. This guide will show you how to install cIOS on your Wii Mini.

## Requirements

- A USB drive formatted as FAT32 (the one you have used previously will work)
- [d2xl cIOS Installer](assets/files/wiiminid2xlcios.zip)
- A way to transfer files to the USB drive

## Preparing d2xl cIOS Installer

First, plug the USB drive into whatever you are using to transfer files to it.

Extract the d2xl .zip file that you downloaded earlier.

Move its contents to the ``apps`` folder on your USB drive.

Eject the USB drive

## Installing d2xl cIOS

Plug the USB drive into your console and turn it on.

Next, open the Homebrew Channel on your Wii Mini. There should now be an app named **d2xl cIOS Installer**. Select this app and press **Load**.

You will then see a screen with options to select. Change the options as follows:

- ``cIOS: d2xl-v1-beta2``
- ``cIOS base: 57``
- ``cIOS slot: 249``

When you have adjusted all the settings, the screen should look similar to this:

Once you have verified the settings, press ``A`` to install. It may take a little while.

If you get an error regarding the revision number, highlight the ``cIOS`` option, and change the cIOS one to the right, then try installing it again.

When the installation has completed, press ``B`` to exit the installer.

You are now done installing cIOS on your Wii Mini.
