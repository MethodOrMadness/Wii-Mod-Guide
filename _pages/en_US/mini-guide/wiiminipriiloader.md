Priiloader is a program that runs before the System Menu (hence the name) and can provide some brick protection as well as some useful features. In this guide, you will install Priiloader and adjust some of the basic settings.

## Requirements

- A USB drive formatted as FAT32 (the one you used previously to load the HackMii Installer will work)
- [Priiloader version 0.9 or newer](https://github.com/DacoTaco/priiloader/releases)
- A way to transfer files to the USB drive
- A USB keyboard

## Preparing Priiloader

First, plug the USB drive into whatever you are using to transfer files to it.

Next, extract the Priiloader .zip you downloaded earlier.

Inside, there will be a folder named ``apps``, along with multiple other files. Move the ``apps`` folder to the root of your USB drive.

Finally, eject the USB drive.

## Installing Priiloader

Begin by inserting the USB drive into your console.

Next, open the Homebrew Channel on your Wii Mini.

You should now see the Priiloader app on screen. If you don't, press ``1`` on your Wii Remote and select ``USB``.

Select the Priiloader app and press ``Load``. You will now be in the Priiloader installer.

In the Priiloader installer, once it finishes loading, press ``+`` to install Priiloader.

When the installation is complete, exit the installer and return to the Homebrew Channel.

## Using Priiloader

If your console is currently turned on, turn it off.

Unplug your USB drive and plug in your USB keyboard.

Hold down the ``ESC`` key on your keyboard and turn on your console. It should now boot to Priiloader. Keep the key held until it does.

Once it boots to Priiloader, select the ``System Menu Hacks`` option

We recommend that you enable the following hacks:

- ``Block Disc Updates``
- ``Block Online Updates``

Once you are done, press ``Save Settings``, and then press ``B`` to exit.

If you would like to avoid using your USB keyboard every time you want to load Priiloader, you can go to ``Settings``, change ``Autoboot`` to ``Priiloader``, and save settings. Now, your console will boot to Priiloader every time you turn it on, but you can simply select the ``System Menu`` option to get to the System Menu.

Then, you can choose the ``System Menu`` option to exit Priiloader.

At this point, you can continue on to [installing cIOS](/wiiminicios)
