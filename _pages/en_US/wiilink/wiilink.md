WiiLink is a service that revives channels for the Wii that only released in Japan, including Wii no Ma and Digicam Prints Channel.

For a more simpler installation, we recommend you use the [console patcher](#using-the-console-patcher), however, this does not include the Nintendo Channel. For using the Nintendo Channel, please use the [desktop patcher](#using-the-desktop-patcher).

## Using the console patcher

### Prerequisites

- An SD card or USB flash drive
- A modded Wii system with an Internet connection
- The latest version of the [WiiLink Console Patcher](https://github.com/WiiLink24/WiiLink24-Patcher/releases/tag/v1.0.7-v1.0.5-v1.0.1)

Make sure to get the patcher for the correct console.

### Setting up

2. Launch the Homebrew Channel and open Wii Mod Lite.
3. Using the +Control Pad, navigate to `WAD Manager` and press `A` on the WiiLink Patcher.
4. After the channel is installed, return to the Wii menu and launch the WiiLink Patcher.

### Installing channels

1. Select the channel you would like to install by pressing `A` over the designated option.

## Setting personal data

WiiLink is unable to access your personal data due to security reasons. If you feel like your data may be unsafe, we recommend setting a PIN code within the channel.
{: .notice--warning}

Setting your personal data is required for a few of our channels, including Digicam Prints Channel and Food Channel.

Make sure to fill in correct information or some of our services may not work correctly.
