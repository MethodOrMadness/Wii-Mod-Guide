In this guide, you will be setting up USB Loader GX, an easy to use program that will allow you to backup and load games on an external USB device, load channels, homebrew apps, and more.

## What you'll need

- An SD card or USB drive formatted as FAT32.
- A games USB drive to store games on (throughout this guide, this will be referred to as your game drive). If you do not plan on backing up GameCube games, format it as NTFS. If you plan on backing up GameCube games, format it as FAT32.
- [USB Loader GX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbloadergx/files/Releases/New%20revisions%20%283.0%2B%29/USBLoaderGX%20r1271.7z/download)
- A way to transfer files to your SD card or USB drive

## Setting up USB Loader GX

Plug in your SD card or USB drive into whatever you are using to transfer files to it

Then, extract the USB Loader GX .7z that you downloaded earlier.

Inside the extracted folder, you will find a folder named ``apps``. Transfer that to the root of your SD card or USB drive. If you already have an ``apps`` folder, it will merge with it.

Once you have done this, you may eject your SD card or USB drive.

Insert your SD card into your Wii, or if you are using a USB drive, insert it into the USB port on your Wii that is furthest away from the edge.

Insert your game drive into the USB port on your Wii that is closest to the edge.

On your Wii, open the Homebrew Channel and launch USB Loader GX. Once you launch it, you should see the USB Loader GX logo and several loading messages below it. Eventually, it should load to the main USB Loader GX interface.

USB Loader GX is now ready for use.

## Backing up Wii games to your USB drive

Backing up your Wii games onto your game drive is an extremely simple process.

Insert the Wii disc that you would like to rip into the disc drive.

Once you have done that, you can either wait for the on screen prompt to show up, where you can choose to install the game, or you can press the ``+`` button in the bottom left of the menu and confirm that you would like to install the game.

USB Loader GX will now proceed to rip the disc onto your game drive. Wait for it to complete, then press ``OK``.

Repeat this process for each of the games you wish to backup.

## Downloading game covers (requires an internet connection)

USB Loader GX's UI will show you the covers for the games you have on your game drive, but you have to download them first.

Do note that you will be required to be connected to the internet in order to do this.

Once you are connected to the internet, load USB Loader GX and press ``1`` on your Wii Remote. This will bring up a download menu. Ensure all the boxes are checked, and then start the download. It may take a while depending on how many games you have and your internet speed.

When it is done downloading, press ``OK``, and your game covers will now show up.

You are now done setting up USB Loader GX and backing up your games.
