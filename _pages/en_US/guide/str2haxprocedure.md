In this guide, you will use the **str2hax** exploit to softmod your Wii.

## Procedure

First, turn on your console. On the Wii Menu, press the Wii button in the bottom left. On the screen that follows, choose ``Wii Options``.

Press the ``+`` button until you see the option labeled ``Internet``. Press that option.

Then, choose ``Connection Settings``, and click on the connection you are currently using.

Next, choose ``Change settings``, and press the ``+`` button until you see ``Auto-Obtain DNS``.

Select ``No``, and then press ``Advanced Settings``.

Change the Primary DNS to ``97.74.103.14``, and change the secondary DNS to ``173.201.71.14``. Don't worry about any extra zeros. They are added automatically.

Once you have set the DNS, press ``Confirm``, and then press ``Save``.

Then, press ``OK``. It will then begin a connection test.

When the connection test is complete, if it succeeded, say ``No`` to the System Update. If it failed, your ISP is blocking the use of custom DNS, and you will have to use an SD card and LetterBomb instead of str2hax.

Next, go back to the Internet settings, then press the ``User Agreements`` option.

Press ``Yes``. You should see a blue background with a pony if the exploit is working. It should load the HackMii Installer Scam Screen within 2-3 minutes. If it doesn't load in that time or your cursor is frozen and you can't move it, force shutdown your Wii, turn it back on, and try again.

Once you are at the HackMii Installer Scam Screen, you may continue to the HackMii Installer.
