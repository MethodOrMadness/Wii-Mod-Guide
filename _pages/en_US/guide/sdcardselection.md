An SD Card is a very useful tool when modding a Wii. It is not required, but if you don't use one, you wlll not be able to use some homebrew. We highly recommend you use an SD card that is at least 2GB in size.

If you have an SD card, continue [here](/letterbombrequirements)

If you do not have an SD card, continue [here](/str2haxrequirements)
