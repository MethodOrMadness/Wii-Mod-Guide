Priiloader is a program that runs before the System Menu (hence the name) and can provide some brick protection as well as some useful features. In this guide, you will install Priiloader and adjust some of the basic settings.

## Requirements

- An SD card or USB drive formatted as FAT32
- [Priiloader](https://github.com/DacoTaco/priiloader/releases/latest) (We recommend that you don't install a beta version)
- A way to transfer files to the SD card/USB drive

## Preparing Priiloader

First, plug your SD card/USB drive into whatever you are using to transfer files to it.

Next, extract the Priiloader .zip you downloaded earlier.

Inside, there will be a folder named ``apps``, along with multiple other files. Move the ``apps`` folder to the root of your SD card/USB drive.

Finally, eject the SD card/USB drive.

## Installing Priiloader

Begin by inserting the SD card/USB drive into your console.

Next, open the Homebrew Channel on your Wii.

You should now see the Priiloader app on screen. If you don't, press ``1`` on your Wii Remote and select SD or USB, depending on what you are using.

Select the Priiloader app and press ``Load``. You will now be in the Priiloader installer.

In the Priiloader installer, once it finishes loading, press ``+`` to install Priiloader.

When the installation is complete, exit the installer and return to the Homebrew Channel.

## Using Priiloader

If your console is currently turned on, turn it off.

Hold down the ``RESET`` button on the console, and while you are holding it down, press and release the power button. Do not release the reset button until you see the Priiloader menu. If you have BootMii installed as boot2, it may show up instead of Priiloader. In this case, boot to the System Menu, and while on the System Menu, hold down the reset button until Priiloader shows up.

Once it boots to Priiloader, select the ``System Menu Hacks`` option

We recommend that you enable the following hacks:

- ``Block Disc Updates``
- ``Block Online Updates``
- ``Region Free EVERYTHING``

Then, press ``Save Settings`` at the bottom, and press ``B`` to go back to the main menu. You can now exit Priiloader by choosing the ``System Menu`` option.

At this point, you can continue on to [making a NAND backup](/wiinandbackup)
