title: Using a USB Hub
---
In order to use homebrew and ethernet on the Wii Mini at the same time, a USB hub is required, as the Wii Mini only has one USB port, and there is no other way to load homebrew on it.

We recommend purchasing a powered USB hub with a built in ethernet port, such as [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Unitek-Ethernet-Converter-Charging-Compatible/dp/B06XKZLZXL). If you do not get a powered USB hub, the console may not be able to provide enough power for all your USB devices.


Once you have a USB hub, you may proceed to [enabling Ethernet on your Wii Mini](/wiiminiethernet)
