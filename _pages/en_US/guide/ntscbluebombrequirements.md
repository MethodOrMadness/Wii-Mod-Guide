## Things you need

Before you can begin, you'll need the following things:

- A computer (with Bluetooth support, either built in or using a USB adapter) **running Linux**
  - There are many ways to do this, but we recommend creating a Live USB. You can find many tutorials on how to do this online. We recommend using the latest version of Ubuntu.
  - If you are using a Live USB, you will need a USB drive that is at least 4GB.
  - You will need to be connected to the internet while you are on Linux.
  - Make sure it is near your Wii Mini. We recommend keeping it within 10 feet.
- A Wii Mini (obviously)
  - Make sure you have a Wiimote that is synced to the console, so that you can connect it in the HackMii Installer later on.
  - While not necessary, it's helpful to have your console connected to a display while performing the hack.
- A USB drive with at least 2GB of storage formatted as FAT32
  - It cannot be the same one as your Live USB.
  - You need a way to transfer files to it.
- The latest version of the [Hackmii Installer](https://bootmii.org/download/)

## Preparing the exploit USB

In order to use Bluebomb, you will have to have a program for the Wii to execute. This is where the USB Drive comes in.

1: Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32.

2: Extract the HackMii Installer .zip that you downloaded previously.

3: Inside the extracted contents, find ``boot.elf`` (not ``bootmini.elf``!) and move it to the root of your USB drive.

4: Eject the USB drive from your computer.
