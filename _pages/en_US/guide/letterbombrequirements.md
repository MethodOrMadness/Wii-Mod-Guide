Before you begin with the **LetterBomb** exploit, here are some things you will need.

## Requirements
- An SD Card formatted as FAT32
- An internet connected device that you can use to transfer files to the SD card
- A Wii with the time and date set correctly (this is very important!)

## Finding your Wii's MAC Address and region
First, you will need your Wii's MAC Address.

To find this, turn on your Wii, and on the Wii Menu, press the Wii button in the bottom left, and in the screen that follows, choose ``Wii Settings``.

Then, in the top right, you will see some numbers and a letter. This corresponds to your Wii's System Menu version and region. Remember what the letter is. You will need it later.

Navigate to the right using the ``+`` button on your Wii Remote until you see the ``Internet`` option. Click on it.

Next, choose the ``Console Information`` button.

The MAC Address is the series of numbers and letters listed on the top. Take note of this, as you will need it later.

## Preparing LetterBomb
Insert your SD card into the device you are using to transfer files to it.

Then, navigate to [please.hackmii.com](https://please.hackmii.com).

On this site, first choose the letter that corresponds with the one you saw on your Wii earlier.

Next, enter the MAC Address you found earlier, without the dashes.

Ensure the ``Bundle with HackMii Installer`` option is checked, then complete the captcha.

Finally, choose the button at the bottom to cut either the red or blue wire. It doesn't matter which one you choose.

You will now download ``Letterbomb.zip``. Extract the .zip file.

Inside, you will find some contents. Transfer the ``private`` folder and ``boot.elf`` to the root of your SD card.

Once that has been completed, eject the SD card.

Now, you may continue to [executing LetterBomb](/letterbombprocedure)
