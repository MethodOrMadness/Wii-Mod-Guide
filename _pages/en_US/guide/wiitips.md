title: Wii Homebrew Tips
---

Great job! You've now fully softmodded your Wii and, if you chose to do so, set up a USB Loader.

Before we let you go, we'd like to give you a few tips/warnings to keep in mind as you run homebrew on your Wii to avoid bricks and overall improve your experience.

- Do not mess with the System Menu unless you know what you're doing and have BootMii installed as boot2. Otherwise, you could end up with a permanent brick.
- Make sure that when you are installing WADs and themes, you are installing ones that are correct and will work on your Wii. Even if you mess up, as long as you followed this guide, you will have Priiloader and will be able to correct your mistake.
- Anything that requires an SD Card (BootMii, CTGP-R, etc.) will not work without an SD card. Duh.

Enjoy your homebrewed Wii!

At the moment, we have no other tutorials to offer, but stay tuned! More will be added in the future.
