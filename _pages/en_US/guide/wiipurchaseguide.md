So, you're looking to buy a Wii. But which one do you buy? Well, this page will help you with that very thing.

The good news is that all models of the Wii can be modded, with some being a bit easier than others.

Rather than going into a deep explanation of each model, here's a quick breakdown of each one:

## Wii (RVL-001)

This is the original model Wii. Its main advantage is that it comes with the capability to play GameCube games straight out of the box, and has some more homebrew vulnerabilities since it's older. If you are looking to play GameCube games and/or run risky homebrew on your Wii, this is the model to get.

## Wii Family Edition (RVL-101)

This is the first revised version of the Wii. It is almost exactly the same as the original Wii, except it has no GameCube compatibility (though it can be restored through modding it), it has some of the vulnerabilities present in its predecessor patched (though it's still just as easy to mod), and it has a newer board (though later models of the original Wii have this as well) that uses less power and runs cooler.

## Wii Mini (RVL-201)

This is the first and only major redesign of the Wii. It is completely different from its predecessors. It has no internet connectivity (though it can be connected through homebrew and a USB adapter), no SD card slot, no GameCube compatibility, and only one USB port. The main reason you might want a Wii Mini is because it's a fun new challenge to mod it and get things working on it.
