Before you mod your Wii, we recommend that you update your Wii's System Menu version to ``4.3``.

## Internet Update

The easiest way to do this is to connect your Wii to the internet. You can do this in the ``Wii Settings`` menu by navigating to the ``Internet`` option, choosing ``Connection Settings``, choosing the Connection you would like to use, and follow the on-screen setup instructions.

Once you have completed the setup and completed the connection test, at the end of the connection test it will ask you to update the System Menu. Select ``Yes``.

The System Menu will now begin to update. Let it complete.

## Offline Update

If you are unable to connect to the internet, you will need to use a newer game disc to update.

Insert the newest game disc you have into your Wii (the best bet is anything from 2010 or later), and go to the ``Disc Channel``. If the update is new enough, the Disc Channel will prompt for an update. Follow the prompts to update.

Once the update is done, make sure you are now on ``4.3``. If you aren't, then the update on disc isn't new enough, and you will have to find a way to connect to the internet.

Once you are on ``4.3``, you can continue [here](/sdcardselection)
